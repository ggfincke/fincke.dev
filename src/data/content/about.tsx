    intro: `I'm a software engineer with experience in full-stack development, data engineering, and statistical modeling.
            I'm passionate about crafting clean, accessible, and performant code that solves real-world problems.`,
    
    journey: `My journey in software development began when I was introducted to Scratch in middle school.
              I fell in love with it immediately and never stopped coding since! I continued to code in high school, 
              eventually choosing to go to Penn State where I developed the majority of my skills in computer science and software engineering. 
              Since then, I've been expanding my skills through both professional work and personal projects.`,
    
    personal: `Outside of coding, I find balance through various outlets, primarily swimming, running, and journaling. 
               Physical fitness is a big part of my life, and I find it helps me stay focused and balanced. I find it very satisfying
               to set big goals and work steadily toward them. Lately, I've been eyeing a full marathon and/or open water swim races.
               Additionally, when I have the time, I like to produce music and play video games, and when I have the money, I love to travel!`
